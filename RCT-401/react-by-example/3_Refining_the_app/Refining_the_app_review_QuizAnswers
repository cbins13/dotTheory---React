1. What is refactoring code?
- Rewriting code to be clearner, but not changing how it functions.

2. How did we fix the "filter bug"?
- By creating ID's for each guest that were independently generatedd from the array index.

3. Breaking apps into components allows us to organize and simplify an app's structure.
- True

4. If you `import` or `require` from a directory rather than a file, what file inside that directory will JavaScript look for by default?
- index.js

5. Why was the app not able to target the correct component when the filter was engaged?
- Because rendering fewer elements potentially assigned different indexes than the corresponding guests in the app state.
