1. Which of the following best describes unidirectional data flow?
- React flows any data changes at the top down through the component tree updating each component.

2. Can two or more components access and share the same state?
- Yes. A parrent component can pass state down to its children via props.

3. When two or more components need access to the same state, we hoise the state into their common parent. This is called:
- lifting state

4. React allows us to use props that are callback functions to communicate data upstream, from a child to a parent.
- True. That's how a child component can access functions and change state defined in its parent component.

- e.target.value, this.state.value, onChange

6. Complete the code to bring in all student objects in the previous state into the students array in setState().
